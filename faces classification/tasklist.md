# Eigenfaces tasks

### Part 1

---
- [x] From-scratch PCA
- [x] SVM (grid)
- [x] Logistic regression [one vs all] (grid)
- [x] one vs one (grid) * must be reviewed
- [x] k-nearest neighbors (grid)

### Part 2

---
- [ ] Build a separate PCA space for each individual. Then, try also to use for classification, the PCA reconstruction error for each class to decide the correct class of an image. We expect that the correct class is the one which gives the minimum reconstruction error, when a given image is projected onto the PCA space of that class. 
- [ ] Explore PCA vs Auto-encoder
- [ ] Finish report (Overleaf)
