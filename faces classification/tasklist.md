# Eigenfaces tasks

- [x] From-scratch PCA
- [x] SVM (grid)
- [ ] Logistic regression (grid)
- [ ] one vs one (grid)
- [ ] k-nearest neighbors
- [ ] Build a separate PCA space for each individual. Then, try also to use for classification, the PCA reconstruction error for each class to decide the correct class of an image. We expect that the correct class is the one which gives the minimum reconstruction error, when a given image is projected onto the PCA space of that class.
